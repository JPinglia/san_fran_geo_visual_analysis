# San Francisco's Real Estate Market Analysis 2010-2016

The San Francisco real estate market was analyzed over a period of 6 years starting in 2010 until 2016. Two major factors were considered:
1) Rent increases
2) Cost increase per square foot, relating to sale of housing.

These factors were considered to help our company consider the use of a new one click rent and sale technology. As the real estate market in San Francisco is hot, this exercise will help the company make key decision to help us move ahead.
